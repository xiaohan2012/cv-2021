Currently, I work on \href{http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html}{{\bf extreme classification\/}} and {\bf algorithmic fairness\/}.

My long-term vision is two-fold:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{``democratizing'' machine learning, making machine learning usable by everyone, }
  \item{and leveraging algorithms to address societal issues}
\end{itemize}
My technical background is approximation algorithms, data mining, and social network analysis.
% Previously, I had experience with online polarization and network cascade reconstruction.
